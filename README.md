# DFS vs BFS using Mathematical Computing

Research Paper written with Kunal Suman  
as part of the Discrete Mathematics course Final Project

We run large simulations of different types of graphs with Depth First Search and Breadth First Search Algorithm.  
Then numerically comapare and contrasts the performance of DFS and BFS with different metrics.  
And also emperically test the belief "DFS outperforms BFS for more extensive graphs".
